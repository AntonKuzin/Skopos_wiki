# Tips for RP-1 telecommunications contracts

## Constellation design

A single satellite in MEO (at a sufficiently high altitude to be above the horizon for the stations to be linked) should be sufficient to satisfy all of the experimental contracts. However, bear in mind that once sustained connections are required, more satellites are needed. The following are possible:
- An MEO constellation,
- A GEO satellite for each link (e.g., one above the Atlantic, one above the Pacific, etc.),
- A Молния constellation.

Other options are possible; for instance, an MEO constellation providing some basic global level of service could be complemented by GEO or Молния satellites providing additional capacity in some regions.

The ground stations for the telecommunications contracts up the mid-seventies are large dishes with a lot of transmission power. It is therefore viable to use relatively modest antennas on the satellites for ground-to-satellite and satellite-to-ground communications.  In contrast, intersatellite communications are for all practical purposes outside the reach of the technology available in that timeframe. If a link cannot be established directly, it is best to bounce the signal between the ground and relay satellites in space.

## Spacecraft design

The following transmitter powers are viable for experimental and level 1 contracts:
* x W for an omnidirectional antenna in MEO;
* y W for an omnidirectional antenna in GEO;
* z W for [dish type] in a Молния orbit.
